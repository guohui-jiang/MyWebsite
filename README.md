# Go to https://yourusername.github.io/reponame/name_of_paper.pdf. Replace yourusername with your user name and reponame with whatever you called your repo. So, for instance, my username is khwilson and the repo above is TestRepo, so I would go to https://guohui-jiang.github.io/MyWebsite/d4.pdf. (This is case sensitive!)
# When you go back to your GitHub repository, you’ll probably be on the “master” branch. Make sure the branch button says “gh-pages.” If it does not, then click it and choose gh-pages first.
